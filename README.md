# AAI Loaders: Krastorio 2 Costs

Makes all loaders created by [Earendel's AAI Loaders](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/aai-loaders) mod
cheaper to craft, by changing their recipes to be similar to Krastorio 2.

## Details

- AAI Loaders is forced into the "expensive" unlubricated mode, to ensure none of the lubricant supply scripting is executed.
- Unlubricated recipes adjusted to cost:
  - Loaders: 1 transport belt, 2 iron plates, 10 iron gear wheels
  - Fast Loaders: 1 fast belt, 2 loaders, 10 iron gear wheels
  - Express Loaders: 1 express belt, 2 fast loaders, 10 steel plates
  - Turbo Loaders (Space Age): 1 turbo belt, 2 fast loaders, 10 tungsten plates
